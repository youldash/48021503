Here you'll find implementations of various programming topics in C, with detailed explanations of how they work.

If you're a **UQU Computer Science/Engineering student** who needs to learn this stuff for exams/quizzes -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!

> Please note: This is a work in progress...
